"""Template for Skybrush Server extensions.

This template is suitable for more complex extensions that may span multiple
files. ``__init__.py`` simply contains the metadata of the extension, and
imports the actual extension from another file. For simpler extensions, you
may put everything into a single file instead.

The entry point of the extension may be defined either by providing an
async ``run()`` function in this file, or by providing a synchronous
``construct()`` method that creates a new instance of the extension when
invoked with no arguments. The extension returned from the ``construct()``
method must be an object derived from ``flockwave.server.ext.base.Extension``.
When using the ``run()`` function, the entire module will be the extension;
whemn using an instance, the extension itself is the object returned from
``construct()``.  The former approach is preferred for simpler, mostly
stateless extensions (state can be stored in module-level variables). The
latter is preferred for more complex extensions as they can use the constructed
instance to store state.

You may also provide a ``get_schema()`` function instead of the schema itself
